# MHT-analysis-package
MATLAB analysis tools for symphony data

Included are many of the general analysis tools I use in the Rieke lab. Some of this code will be quite specific to the way data is mapped and organized within the Rieke lab, but other general utilities (e.g. in Modeling & Utilities) are quite general purpose.

Some of this code began as common Rieke lab analysis code (e.g. the EpochTreeGUI began as a lab-wide tool, I have pared it down and added some functionality for selecting cell populations and example cells).
